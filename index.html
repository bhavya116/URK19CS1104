		<h1>QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION USING ARRAY</h1>

	<p class="margin">The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue.

	<p class="margin">The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection. Queues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes.</p>	
	<br>

	<p class="margin">There are several efficient implementations of FIFO queues. An efficient implementation is one that can perform the operationsâ€”en-queuing and de-queuing.</p>
